# Crop-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting crop types using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The key features of this repository are:

Preprocessing with OpenCV:
OpenCV is used for image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and augmentations to prepare the dataset for training.

Deep Learning Model - VGG16:
The VGG16 model, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, is fine-tuned to classify different crop types. The transfer learning approach leverages VGG16's deep feature extraction capabilities to achieve high accuracy on the dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset contains labeled images of various crop types. Each image is preprocessed and fed into the model for classification.

Key Highlights:

Image preprocessing using OpenCV for robust feature extraction.
Implementation of VGG16 for transfer learning.
Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Achieved 97% accuracy on the Inception model, but VGG16 results can be compared and optimized further.
